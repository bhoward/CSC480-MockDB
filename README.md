# CSC480-MockDB

This is a project to create realistic data for the sample database in
Sciore's "Database Design and Implementation" (1st Edition). It approaches
the task by simulating multiple years of course enrollment at a university,
attempting to generate realistic course registrations as students work on
classes required for various major departments.
